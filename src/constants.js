Merely sending probes and rovers to the moon and Mars won't do. For various reasons, adventure, apocalypse, commerce, we insist upon taking our corporeal selves off world too. Multiple private companies have announced plans to put hotels in space soon. NASA is aiming to threed print lunar neighborhoods within a couple of decades. And while it will probably take longer than that to build and populate an out Coast on Mars, preparations are being made. This summer, 4 NASA crew members began a 378 day stay in simulated Martian housing at the Johnson Space Center in Houston. When you look at the renderings of these cozy dwellings, it's easy to lose sight of how hostile space is to Earthlings. As a reminder, consider what would happen if you found yourself in low Earth orbit or on Mars or the Moon without a space suit on. You would pass out from a lack of oxygen within a matter of seconds, a condition known as hypoxia and die soon thereafter. In the brief meantime all the gases inside your body including any air still in your lungs would expand in the absence of external pressure. Depressurization would also cause your internal fluids to bubble. Not because they're heating up, but because they are transmogrifying into their gaseous state. The temperature wouldn't be much of a problem, at least, even though thermometers in low Earth orbit produce readings from minus 85 degrees to 257°F depending on whether they are in shadow or in light. Space as a near vacuum has very little mass to conduct heat to or away from you, so you are not likely to feel instantly hot or cold. While hypoxia is potentially a real threat, should your space vessel or extraterrestrial habitat leak, it's a manageable one. Assuming you haven't leaped naked out of your space capsule or off-world dwelling. But 2 other major challenges confront our fragile bodies when we leave our planet, neither of which has been entirely solved yet. Even indoors. Variable gravity. And radiation. Gravity is determined by the mass of objects and their distance from one another. Because Earth is so big, it is impossible, while on it, to escape its gravity for any serious length of time. As a result, we don't know very much about what our lives would be like without or under some diminished influence of this omnipresent attraction. On the moon and on Mars, which are smaller than our world, the gravitational tug will be much less, a sixth and a third respectively of what it is here. Conversely, radiation exposure intensifies with elevation because there's less atmosphere above you to block it. And to incur a much larger dose if you get beyond the protective bubble of Earth's ozone and magnetosphere, the magnetic field that stretches roughly 40,000 miles out at its most compressed point. The solar and galactic radiation that washes over Mars, which at its closest is 34 million miles away, will potentially be 700 times as great as what passes through our magnetic defenses. Space travelers beyond low Earth orbit will also be bombarded with high-energy atomic nuclei from exploding stars throughout the galaxy, which are normally deflected by the magnetosphere from reaching the surface of our planet. Those particles are so heavy and moving so fast that they penetrate spaceships, space suits, and skin, banging into other particles in their path and damaging any attendant cells in ways researchers are only beginning to understand. So far, most of what we know about the effects on the human body of these threats comes from astronauts in low Earth orbit. And because safety is a paramount concern, we don't send many of them up there. And we don't let them stay for long when we do. 6 months is the average length of a visit to the International Space Station and fewer than 300 people have made the 250 mile voyage. While that collective experience is enough to have taught us how the body responds when gravity's pull is substantially reduced, The magnetosphere still shields the ISS and only the 24 astronauts who flew in the Apollo program have gone beyond it. The moon orbits an average of more than 238,000 miles away. Though these 2 dozen astronauts spent little more than a week at a time without its protection, They have died of cardiovascular disease at a rate 4 to 5 times as high as that of their counterparts who stayed in low Earth orbit or never entered orbit at all, which suggests that exposure to cosmic radiation might have damaged their arteries, veins, and capillaries. We can't send people to Mars or to live on the moon until we can be reasonably confident that they'll survive getting and residing there. But the space-based medical science needed to make that possible has been hindered by small sample sizes that aren't representative of the general population. All of the Apollo astronauts were white men born between 1,928 and 1936. Space tourism, though, promises to offer opportunities to study the effects of radiation and low gravity on a much broader demographic than really well selected super people, as Doree Donnaville, the director of the Translational Research Institute for Space Health. Trish at the Baylor College of Medicine describes those who have historically qualified to leave the planet. Old, young, pre-existing health conditions, we are starting to gather a knowledge base that in the future will be essential even for NASA. Doneville told me. Because we have to learn about the edge cases to really understand what is going on in our bodies to adapt to a hostile environment. You don't learn as much from people who are healthy. It's when people get sick that you understand how people get sick and how to prevent it. Epidemiologists face the same predicament on Earth. Before they can figure out how to protect the population, they must wait for harm to come to enough people to expose the causes. Less rigorous medical screening allows more tourists to reach space, the chances increase significantly that someone will get hurt or have a health emergency there.
